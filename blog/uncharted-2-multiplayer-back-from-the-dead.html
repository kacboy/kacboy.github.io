Thanks to a dedicated user named Force, players can once again dive into the nostalgic battles of this classic game. If you've been longing to revisit Uncharted 2's online multiplayer, now's your chance.</p><h2>The History of Uncharted 2's Multiplayer Shutdown</h2><p>Back in 2019, Sony officially shut down the multiplayer servers for Uncharted 2, Uncharted 3, and The Last of Us on PS3. While The Last of Us Remastered on PS4 still maintains its factions multiplayer mode, and Uncharted 3 multiplayer was brought back through LAN networking solutions, Uncharted 2 was left in the dark. Due to its requirement for a network handshake and lack of built-in LAN functionality, reviving the game seemed nearly impossible—until now.</p><h2>The Revival of Uncharted 2 Multiplayer</h2><p>A user named Force has successfully restored Uncharted 2's multiplayer servers, making it possible for players to enjoy custom matches once again. He revealed that the necessary network data and files had already been captured five years ago, yet no one had managed to bring it back online—until now.</p><p>I was fortunate enough to test his server solution firsthand, and let me tell you, the experience was surreal. If you still own a PS3 and a copy of Uncharted 2 (digital or physical), you can now hop back into multiplayer and co-op modes. Even better, Force is working on an RPCS3 emulator version, which will allow PC players to join in the future.</p><figure class="post__video"><iframe loading="lazy" width="560" height="314" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qyHfMbsKG74" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></figure><h2>How to Get Started</h2><p>If you're eager to jump back into Uncharted 2 multiplayer, here’s how you can set up access to the revived servers:</p><h3>Step 1: Join the Discord Community</h3><p>To get access to the server, you’ll need to join Force’s Discord server (linked below). There, you can get your PlayStation Network (PSN) name approved and receive the necessary DNS IP address to connect to the multiplayer servers.</p><h3>Step 2: Configure Your PS3 Network Settings</h3><ol><li><p>On your PS3, navigate to <strong>Settings &gt; Network Settings</strong>.</p></li><li><p>Select <strong>Settings and Connection Status List</strong> and take note of your current IP address, subnet mask, and default router address.</p></li><li><p>Go to <strong>Internet Connection Settings</strong>, select <strong>Custom</strong>, and choose either <strong>Wired</strong> or <strong>Wireless</strong> based on your setup.</p></li><li><p>When you reach the <strong>IP Address Setting</strong> section, choose <strong>Manual</strong> and enter the details you noted earlier.</p></li><li><p>For <strong>Primary DNS</strong>, enter the DNS IP address provided in the Discord server.</p></li><li><p>(Optional) If you experience connection issues, set the <strong>Secondary DNS</strong> to <strong>8.8.8.8</strong>.</p></li><li><p>Save the settings and test your internet connection.</p></li></ol><p>If your internet and PSN connections are successful, you should be ready to launch Uncharted 2 multiplayer!</p><h3>Troubleshooting Tips</h3><ul><li><p><strong>Game Freezing at the Loading Screen?</strong> Go to <strong>Game Data Utility</strong>, delete Uncharted 2’s game data, and reinstall all updates.</p></li><li><p><strong>Syncing Live Data Takes Too Long?</strong> The first connection might take a while, but subsequent attempts should be much faster.</p></li><li><p><strong>DLC Availability Issues?</strong> It varies by PSN region, so try accessing the PlayStation Store directly instead of the in-game store.</p></li></ul><h2>What to Expect in Multiplayer</h2><p>Once you're in, you’ll find that your rank, leaderboards, and trophy progress are still there from 2019. At the moment, only custom games are available, so you’ll need to invite other players to join matches. However, matchmaking is on the roadmap for future updates!</p><p>Additionally, cinema mode works, meaning players can once again create montages and machinima content. This is a fantastic opportunity to relive the golden days of Uncharted 2 multiplayer with a fresh community.</p><h2>Final Thoughts</h2><p>Never in my wildest dreams did I think I’d be playing Uncharted 2 multiplayer again, but here we are! A massive shoutout to Force and the community working behind the scenes to make this happen. If you’re a fan of the series, dust off your PS3 and dive back into one of the best multiplayer experiences ever created.</p><h3>Join the Action</h3><p>To start playing, join the <strong>Discord community</strong> (link below) and follow the steps to set up your connection. Hope to see you in the game!</p><figure class="post__video"><iframe loading="lazy" width="560" height="314" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q1fVvjaXH90" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></figure><hr><p>Uncharted 2 Revived <a href="https://discord.gg/9pJrhnhucz">https://discord.gg/9pJrhnhucz</a><br>Reddit Announcement <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/unchartedmultiplayer/comments/1jfbpm5/uncharted_2_revived_no_gatekeeping_just_pure/">https://www.reddit.com/r/unchartedmultiplayer/comments/1jfbpm5/uncharted_2_revived_no_gatekeeping_just_pure/</a><br>Uncharted 3 Reloaded <a href="https://discord.com/invite/jtvQ7sQcZS">https://discord.com/invite/jtvQ7sQcZS</a><br>Retro Fighters Defender Controller <a href="https://amzn.to/3yNFA7w">https://amzn.to/3yNFA7w</a></p></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="content__last-updated">This article was updated on 2025-03-25</div><div class="content__footer__col"><div class="content__share"></div></div><nav class="content__nav"><div class="content__nav__prev">Previous Post<h5><a href="https://kacboy.com/blog/how-to-watch-3d-movies-on-psvr2-using-free-software.html" class="invert" rel="prev">How to Watch 3D Movies on PSVR2 Using Free Software</a></h5></div></nav></footer></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">@kacboy</div><div class="footer__social"><a href="https://youtube.com/kacboy" class="youtube" aria-label="Youtube"><svg class="icon"><use xlink:href="https://kacboy.com/blog/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#youtube"/></svg></a></div></footer></div><script defer="defer" src="https://kacboy.com/blog/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=4268bfae06e330d473c424d50f09abda"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.navbar'};</script><script>/*<![CDATA[*/var images=document.querySelectorAll("img[loading]");for(var i=0;i<images.length;i++){if(images[i].complete){images[i].classList.add("is-loaded")}else{images[i].addEventListener("load",function(){this.classList.add("is-loaded")},false)}};/*]]>*/</script><script>document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function () {
