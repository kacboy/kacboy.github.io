And with PSVR2 just on the horizon I thought I’d just take a look at this new headset in relation to the existing PSVR and Quest 2 systems.</p><p></p><p></p><p>First of all, PSVR1 is a completely outdated, overpriced system and I’m shocked it still goes for 350USD and 450 canadian. Whoever is still buying these just please stop. The Quest 2 on the other hand is easily the best value of any headset, standalone or not. Even after their recent price increase to $400 USD. The thing about Quest 2 that most people don’t know and Meta doesn’t seem to want you to know is you can use it with a PC and play steam games just the same as any high end $1000 range headset! I suppose if everyone knew that they wouldn’t be spending money on the Oculus store at all. I had a Quest 2 for a bit and I didn’t spend anything beyond the free credit I got on the Oculus store, but I did buy a couple games on steam.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Anyways, taking a look at the new Quest Pro it doesn’t seem to be much of an upgrade if you look at it from the perspective of using it with a seperate PC system. It has nearly identical<br>Specs compared to the Quest 2, and even has a lower resolution! It is supposed to have eye tracking like the PSVR2 though which will make a huge difference in performance both stand alone and connected to a PC. Personally I never used my Quest 2 standalone but the new Pro model is heavier and the battery supposedly lasts only 1-2 hours so I’m really not sure how that’s supposed to be more appealing as a standalone VR unit either. All things considered I think the price of $1500 is just absurd and I’m really not sure who this is for. That’s more than a Valve Index and it doesn’t even have controllers with built in knuckle grips for a more natural hand slash controller experience. Ah.<br><br>So what does this mean for PSVR2? Not much cause even though the Quest Pro is coming out sooner (October 25th), I think PSVR2 will still be closer in competition to the Quest 2 due to the price range and target market. It’s worth noting that the PSVR2 headset has no batteries and practically no need for internal processing power since it requires a wire to the PS5, which is the equivalent of a high-end PC. It’s just a simple headset and controllers, while both the Quest 2 and Pro have internal standalone processors. So price wise it will probably be on par or just below the Quest 2 depending on how much of a loss Sony is willing to take on.<br><br>Currently I think the PSVR2 will be priced at the same $400 USD as the Quest 2, but it might be able to squeeze down to 350 or even 300 if we’re very lucky. Unfortunately in Canada it will probably be an ouchie $500 or more. </p><p></p><p></p><p>Nevertheless I’m sure we’ll get another VR state of play or showcase before the end of the year that will clear up all this speculation before the release early next year.</p><p></p></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="content__last-updated">This article was updated on 2025-03-25</div><div class="content__footer__col"><div class="content__share"></div></div></footer></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">@kacboy</div><div class="footer__social"><a href="https://youtube.com/kacboy" class="youtube" aria-label="Youtube"><svg class="icon"><use xlink:href="https://kacboy.com/blog/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#youtube"/></svg></a></div></footer></div><script defer="defer" src="https://kacboy.com/blog/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=4268bfae06e330d473c424d50f09abda"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.navbar'};</script><script>/*<![CDATA[*/var images=document.querySelectorAll("img[loading]");for(var i=0;i<images.length;i++){if(images[i].complete){images[i].classList.add("is-loaded")}else{images[i].addEventListener("load",function(){this.classList.add("is-loaded")},false)}};/*]]>*/</script><script>document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function () {
