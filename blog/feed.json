            "content_html": "<p>In a surprise turn of events, Uncharted 2 multiplayer has been revived! Thanks to a dedicated user named Force, players can once again dive into the nostalgic battles of this classic game. If you've been longing to revisit Uncharted 2's online multiplayer, now's your chance.</p>\n<h2>The History of Uncharted 2's Multiplayer Shutdown</h2>\n<p>Back in 2019, Sony officially shut down the multiplayer servers for Uncharted 2, Uncharted 3, and The Last of Us on PS3. While The Last of Us Remastered on PS4 still maintains its factions multiplayer mode, and Uncharted 3 multiplayer was brought back through LAN networking solutions, Uncharted 2 was left in the dark. Due to its requirement for a network handshake and lack of built-in LAN functionality, reviving the game seemed nearly impossible‚Äîuntil now.</p>\n<h2>The Revival of Uncharted 2 Multiplayer</h2>\n<p>A user named Force has successfully restored Uncharted 2's multiplayer servers, making it possible for players to enjoy custom matches once again. He revealed that the necessary network data and files had already been captured five years ago, yet no one had managed to bring it back online‚Äîuntil now.</p>\n<p>I was fortunate enough to test his server solution firsthand, and let me tell you, the experience was surreal. If you still own a PS3 and a copy of Uncharted 2 (digital or physical), you can now hop back into multiplayer and co-op modes. Even better, Force is working on an RPCS3 emulator version, which will allow PC players to join in the future.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__video\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"314\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/qyHfMbsKG74\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></iframe></figure>\n<h2>How to Get Started</h2>\n<p>If you're eager to jump back into Uncharted 2 multiplayer, here‚Äôs how you can set up access to the revived servers:</p>\n<h3>Step 1: Join the Discord Community</h3>\n<p>To get access to the server, you‚Äôll need to join Force‚Äôs Discord server (linked below). There, you can get your PlayStation Network (PSN) name approved and receive the necessary DNS IP address to connect to the multiplayer servers.</p>\n<h3>Step 2: Configure Your PS3 Network Settings</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>On your PS3, navigate to <strong>Settings &gt; Network Settings</strong>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Select <strong>Settings and Connection Status List</strong> and take note of your current IP address, subnet mask, and default router address.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Go to <strong>Internet Connection Settings</strong>, select <strong>Custom</strong>, and choose either <strong>Wired</strong> or <strong>Wireless</strong> based on your setup.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>When you reach the <strong>IP Address Setting</strong> section, choose <strong>Manual</strong> and enter the details you noted earlier.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>For <strong>Primary DNS</strong>, enter the DNS IP address provided in the Discord server.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>(Optional) If you experience connection issues, set the <strong>Secondary DNS</strong> to <strong>8.8.8.8</strong>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Save the settings and test your internet connection.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If your internet and PSN connections are successful, you should be ready to launch Uncharted 2 multiplayer!</p>\n<h3>Troubleshooting Tips</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Game Freezing at the Loading Screen?</strong> Go to <strong>Game Data Utility</strong>, delete Uncharted 2‚Äôs game data, and reinstall all updates.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Syncing Live Data Takes Too Long?</strong> The first connection might take a while, but subsequent attempts should be much faster.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>DLC Availability Issues?</strong> It varies by PSN region, so try accessing the PlayStation Store directly instead of the in-game store.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What to Expect in Multiplayer</h2>\n<p>Once you're in, you‚Äôll find that your rank, leaderboards, and trophy progress are still there from 2019. At the moment, only custom games are available, so you‚Äôll need to invite other players to join matches. However, matchmaking is on the roadmap for future updates!</p>\n<p>Additionally, cinema mode works, meaning players can once again create montages and machinima content. This is a fantastic opportunity to relive the golden days of Uncharted 2 multiplayer with a fresh community.</p>\n<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>\n<p>Never in my wildest dreams did I think I‚Äôd be playing Uncharted 2 multiplayer again, but here we are! A massive shoutout to Force and the community working behind the scenes to make this happen. If you‚Äôre a fan of the series, dust off your PS3 and dive back into one of the best multiplayer experiences ever created.</p>\n<h3>Join the Action</h3>\n<p>To start playing, join the <strong>Discord community</strong> (link below) and follow the steps to set up your connection. Hope to see you in the game!</p>\n<figure class=\"post__video\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"314\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q1fVvjaXH90\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></iframe></figure>\n<hr>\n<p>Uncharted 2 Revived <a href=\"https://discord.gg/9pJrhnhucz\">https://discord.gg/9pJrhnhucz</a><br>Reddit Announcement <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/unchartedmultiplayer/comments/1jfbpm5/uncharted_2_revived_no_gatekeeping_just_pure/\">https://www.reddit.com/r/unchartedmultiplayer/comments/1jfbpm5/uncharted_2_revived_no_gatekeeping_just_pure/</a><br>Uncharted 3 Reloaded <a href=\"https://discord.com/invite/jtvQ7sQcZS\">https://discord.com/invite/jtvQ7sQcZS</a><br>Retro Fighters Defender Controller <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3yNFA7w\">https://amzn.to/3yNFA7w</a></p>",

In this guide, I‚Äôll show you step-by-step how to do this without re-encoding your movie files, saving you time and hassle.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__video\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"314\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/KY38deZrl7s?t=240s\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></iframe></figure>\n<h2>What You‚Äôll Need</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>PSVR2 headset</strong> and <strong>PC adapter</strong> (set up and configured for SteamVR)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>A 3D Blu-ray movie</strong> (example: Top Gun 3D)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>A Blu-ray drive for your PC</strong></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>MakeMKV</strong> (to rip the Blu-ray to an MKV file)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>BD3D2MK3D</strong> (to convert the MKV file to a side-by-side 3D format)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>AVISynth+</strong> (a required supplementary tool for BD3D2MK3D)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Bigscreen Beta</strong> (a free VR app on Steam that allows you to watch movies in a virtual theater)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>VLC Media Player</strong> (to play the 3D movie)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Step 1: Rip the 3D Blu-ray with MakeMKV</h2>\n<p>MakeMKV is a free tool that lets you create digital copies of your physical Blu-ray discs. Here‚Äôs how:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Insert your 3D Blu-ray disc into your Blu-ray drive.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Open <strong>MakeMKV</strong> and select the Blu-ray drive.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In the options, <strong>make sure to check the 3D video track</strong>, as it may not be selected by default.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Start the ripping process. <strong>This will take some time</strong> (around an hour or more, depending on your PC and Blu-ray drive).</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Step 2: Convert the MKV File to Side-by-Side 3D Format</h2>\n<p>Once you have your MKV file, you need to convert it into a side-by-side format, which is required for VR playback.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Open <strong>BD3D2MK3D</strong> and drag your newly created MKV file into the program.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Remove any unnecessary audio and subtitle tracks to save space.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Uncheck the ‚Äúhalf-quality‚Äù option if you want <strong>full-quality 3D video</strong> (note: this increases processing time).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Start the conversion. <strong>This can take about an hour</strong>, even on a high-performance computer.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>üí° <em>You‚Äôll also need AVISynth+ installed for this process to work.</em></p>\n<h2>Step 3: Set Up Your Virtual Cinema in Bigscreen Beta</h2>\n<p>With your 3D movie ready, it‚Äôs time to experience it in VR.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Open <strong>SteamVR</strong> and make sure your PSVR2 is properly connected.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Launch <strong>Bigscreen Beta</strong> from your Steam library.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Choose a theater environment (I prefer the fancy home theater setup, but you can pick any you like).</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Step 4: Play Your 3D Movie in VR</h2>\n<p>Now, let‚Äôs get the movie playing in full 3D:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Open VLC Media Player</strong> and load your converted side-by-side 3D movie.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Go full-screen in VLC so it fills the Bigscreen virtual theater.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In Bigscreen Beta, press <strong>R3</strong> on your controller to open the settings.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Select the <strong>3D mode option</strong> and set it to <strong>side-by-side (SBS)</strong>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Your movie should now display correctly in stereoscopic 3D!</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>\n<p>While this process may seem a bit complex, it‚Äôs currently the best free method to watch 3D Blu-ray movies on the PSVR2. Thanks to MakeMKV, BD3D2MK3D, and Bigscreen Beta, you can enjoy your 3D content in a large virtual cinema <strong>without any paid software</strong>.</p>\n<p>If Sony ever enables native 3D Blu-ray support on PS5, this method won‚Äôt be necessary‚Äîbut for now, this is the best solution available.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">MakeMKV</span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&amp;redir_token=QUFFLUhqbGZVVVFabXZtRVY4TVg3dEpjQkdTWmlJYVVqQXxBQ3Jtc0tuRm44MkhkNlhtQWdGS2k3NnFyWkhTYlJQV0dqZXNBZUw2S29TcU5hMHNjQW1YN01iUnVMcjdaZk9XMXhUaDJsS19fV0ljb2N2cnhfQ1BxMkJTWkJNaWdDTUFkMEZUWS1Sc2lPRHBQUjBlaThxdDRsYw&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.makemkv.com%2F&amp;v=KY38deZrl7s\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></a><a href=\"https://www.makemkv.com/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">https://www.makemkv.com/</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br></span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Bigscreen</span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&amp;redir_token=QUFFLUhqbFlfVDNfUXBMbUxtU1ZleXRIbTFuLUV6YlZwZ3xBQ3Jtc0ttSDd4cThlSzdNRUNrSFdsQXVOOW92eFN0U2NjSjNkQ0h1SjBieTgxcUQ5d2NEaHROdTFkcDZad2tEVklHYUxYeGNMOXNKMjdfX2dlRGd5RTlGTkktVFBKQ3FNMnNQVzBfMWNrZjlsbVEwcTRzaGFXbw&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F457550%2FBigscreen_Beta%2F&amp;v=KY38deZrl7s\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></a><a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/45%E2%80%A6\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">https://store.steampowered.com/app/45‚Ä¶</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br></span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> BD3D2MK3D</span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&amp;redir_token=QUFFLUhqbUZMTExzNTFHYVdoMDZqbHNGY0hZS2JodEJSUXxBQ3Jtc0trS0JLN1llcEU2Mno2ODRtd0FxMFBycTFJVHJQc0QyOXpib2gtcDE4TmNGM1NDUFBoQXRVYWJ5MEpIQVBuNVFtNFI1QjhDOHYySkNScVJYbWtOSzk2SXBoblJpLUZmUjZOb1EzcTRyRkVFeW1NVTVSNA&amp;q=http%3A%2F%2Fforum.doom9.org%2Fshowthread.php%3Ft%3D170828&amp;v=KY38deZrl7s\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> http://forum.doom9.org/showthread.php...</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">VLC</span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&amp;redir_token=QUFFLUhqbm5XNHRDUlVkWHE0VU8wYjVNVk1DMEhYRzNod3xBQ3Jtc0ttYmlsZnN0V1BHSUM0NS1JMER3Z25kRHJpRVZXT1diYjNaa2l5emFvdDFFeld4MWhqbS1kb0RhMktXVHd3cU42TnlORk9XR2ZYekpRRGhGLTFma3BEWXFxbXZ2NWdYRjhpeG5iOGNsU0RwMmVyRFVZUQ&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.videolan.org%2F&amp;v=KY38deZrl7s\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> https://www.videolan.org/</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4XVR</span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&amp;redir_token=QUFFLUhqbVhicVEwdFFITTNZUzQxcFV6dUtBZ0JQYjNLUXxBQ3Jtc0treHB3VzBORnFlS2JoQ1NOZUNRSEZleURFT25QT1FTdTlaYVkwN0I4ZzNndThJd1FIZHI4dnpMYUt1b1JZVl9GeEtLX3JXa0pxYkFhb3VPYWx6Z2JOY20zaHE3QklVZ1NRQTdWZXhKejR1SVpjbWVGZw&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fm.4xvr.net%2F&amp;v=KY38deZrl7s\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> https://m.4xvr.net/</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">PS VR2</span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&amp;redir_token=QUFFLUhqbkJ4NHREa3ZodGJSdmt0ck4tMFBkbGQ5cVFyd3xBQ3Jtc0ttTFNyOVBQQmUtaTJZTmhMaVZXWkNlWlBoZk82QWNiZ0Jjc2kwa1RqNW1oc0VnYV9fQ0owSURfTEZWclZpQ2ZGVnVFTmlWUEVuMWR1UFRLMFhOQTBrWGU2WFZReGFQcWsxYjhEM0VLTUl2TFNjVFBIcw&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Famzn.to%2F47TKn4F&amp;v=KY38deZrl7s\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> https://amzn.to/47TKn4F</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">PS VR2 PC Adapter</span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&amp;redir_token=QUFFLUhqbEgwQ2o1Z3FfWlk1Sms1eWRwTWhaak9JVlFoUXxBQ3Jtc0tsaTFJY3BUWTZWY3lobS1vWnZKQmpvX2NQNGV3M3NnOUpyMnJEaDhlcXktSk9BZmdqbnJ2ZlUteU9UMFd0SkhZZXlVcHdJalU4WmRsSkFUMjE3WTdSS0NxczAzbWE5ZjFSOVMxMmU5UHdka0YtM2RWUQ&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Famzn.to%2F3BxVq7B&amp;v=KY38deZrl7s\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> https://amzn.to/3BxVq7B</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Top Gun 3D</span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&amp;redir_token=QUFFLUhqa1p6VVp2cVhTTU9Fb09PYjdYMDFITUFxc2V4QXxBQ3Jtc0ttSk9qOWY4djIzbktGbG85ajZ4Y2VYMmJlTjQxMTJ1V1hiOEE0SGRSV3VwQU9CeUtvdnoxSE9rb2VTYU1XYUZHMzk2ZjFSRE9YNUMzcGxGY09NRFl3TEFjWTlwXzIxSnl3VUxZY2hYVkdDaDNrZFJ4aw&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Famzn.to%2F4h3HylY&amp;v=KY38deZrl7s\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> https://amzn.to/4h3HylY</span></a></p>",

            "content_html": "<p>It‚Äôs been a few months since the PlayStation Portal launched, and while it initially faced mixed and negative feedback, it has been selling incredibly well. In some markets, it remains difficult to find, proving that despite its flaws, there‚Äôs a strong demand for the device. As someone who relies on Remote Play frequently, I picked one up as soon as I could and have been using it regularly. While I have some major gripes with it, I also think it has a lot to offer. Let‚Äôs break it all down, starting with the hardware.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__video\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"314\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/z21i63eJUro\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></iframe></figure>\n<h2>The Hardware: Design Pros and Cons</h2>\n<p>When the PlayStation Portal was first leaked, I did a reaction video, and my opinion hasn‚Äôt changed‚ÄîI still dislike the design. The overall aesthetic of the PS5 generation just doesn‚Äôt appeal to me, especially when compared to previous PlayStation generations. It‚Äôs strange, considering that Mark Cerny has led PlayStation console design since the Vita, yet the PS5 and its accessories feel like such a radical departure from his past work.</p>\n<p>That said, while the Portal looks odd, its form factor is actually fantastic for ergonomics. It sits between the Steam Deck and the Nintendo Switch in size, but many reviews‚Äîand my own experience‚Äîsuggest that it‚Äôs more comfortable to hold than both. This is because it essentially splits a DualSense controller in half, placing the screen in the middle. This design makes it one of the most comfortable handhelds to use for long sessions.</p>\n<p>The placement of the charging port and aux port could be better, as they‚Äôre slightly difficult to reach. However, I do appreciate the small lip on the back of the device, which makes it easy to pick up and hold without smudging the screen. But while the physical design has its strengths, the screen introduces one of the Portal‚Äôs biggest flaws‚Äîits HDR issues.</p>\n<h2>HDR Issues: A Major Problem</h2>\n<p>The PlayStation Portal has significant problems with HDR when streaming via Remote Play. Many users, including myself, have encountered this issue, and the lack of updates to fix it is frustrating. Even worse are the absurd workarounds being suggested online, which are simply unacceptable.<br><br></p>\n<blockquote class=\"reddit-embed-bq\" data-embed-height=\"546\"><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/PlaystationPortal/comments/185m4dc/hdr_comparison_shots/\">HDR Comparison shots</a><br>by<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/bombchu_/\">u/bombchu_</a> in<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/PlaystationPortal/\">PlaystationPortal</a></blockquote>\n<p>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://embed.reddit.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"UTF-8\"></script>\n</p>\n<p>For those unfamiliar, here‚Äôs the problem: the Portal receives an HDR signal from the PS5, despite being an SDR LCD screen that doesn‚Äôt have the luminance range to properly display HDR content. This results in overexposed, blown-out whites, making some games nearly unplayable. For example, in NHL games, the ice and bright jerseys become indistinguishable, creating a terrible experience. I‚Äôve also noticed this issue in games like Spider-Man and Hogwarts Legacy, where the sky turns into a solid white blotch, losing all cloud detail and depth.</p>\n<p>The most commonly suggested solution? Unplugging your PS5‚Äôs HDMI cable every time you want to use Remote Play. That‚Äôs a ridiculous fix that completely defeats the purpose of a remote experience. Other suggestions include turning off VRR, limiting the PS5 to 1080p, or disabling 120Hz refresh rates‚Äîthough these solutions seem more related to latency than HDR. To make matters worse, when using Remote Play, you cannot access the PS5‚Äôs Screen and Video settings to disable HDR, meaning there‚Äôs no easy way to fix this problem without physically interacting with your console.</p>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper gallery-wrapper--wide\"><div class=\"gallery\"  data-is-empty=\"false\" data-translation=\"Add images\" data-columns=\"2\">\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://kacboy.com/blog/media/posts/23/gallery/ps-portal-rant.00_04_17_23.still001.png\" data-size=\"1920x1080\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://kacboy.com/blog/media/posts/23/gallery/ps-portal-rant.00_04_17_23.still001-thumbnail.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://kacboy.com/blog/media/posts/23/gallery/ps-portal-rant.00_04_45_05.still003.png\" data-size=\"1920x1080\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://kacboy.com/blog/media/posts/23/gallery/ps-portal-rant.00_04_45_05.still003-thumbnail.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n</div></div>\n<h2>Testing the Issue: What‚Äôs Really Going On?</h2>\n<p>I ran multiple tests on my PS5, TV, and Portal setup to understand the root of the issue. Here‚Äôs what I found:</p>\n<h3>Test Scenarios</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>HDMI Link (Optimal Setup):</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>HDR Auto ‚Üí Problem occurs</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>HDR Off ‚Üí Fixes the issue</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>HDMI Unplugged:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>HDR Auto ‚Üí Problem occurs</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>HDR Off ‚Üí Fixes the issue</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>No HDMI Link:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>HDR Auto ‚Üí Problem occurs</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>HDR Off ‚Üí Fixes the issue</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The key takeaway? HDMI Link is not the issue; it‚Äôs the way the PS5 interprets HDR compatibility with the TV and sends the signal to the Portal.</p>\n<p>To further verify this, I tested Remote Play using the official Android app and PS Play on a phone that supports HDR. Both apps exhibited the same blown-out whites when HDR was enabled on the PS5 but disabled in the app. However, when HDR was enabled on both the PS5 and the app, the image looked great.</p>\n<p>One interesting discovery: if you connect to your PS5 <strong>while it is already inside the Screen and Video settings menu</strong>, you can still adjust HDR settings remotely. This means the PS5 is capable of dynamically adjusting the HDR output during a Remote Play session‚Äîit just doesn‚Äôt allow users to access these settings normally. A simple firmware update from Sony could fix this by either (1) allowing users to access the Screen and Video settings during Remote Play or (2) automatically disabling HDR output when streaming to a non-HDR device like the Portal.</p>\n<h2>Latency Issues: Improving but Not Perfect</h2>\n<p>Sony released an update (version 2.06) on April 2nd, which reportedly improved video bitrate quality. While I‚Äôve noticed that the Portal now holds its 1080p connection better, some latency and stuttering issues remain. Previously, if my TV was streaming video, the Portal‚Äôs stream quality would degrade and never recover unless I manually disconnected and reconnected. Since the update, it appears to handle these situations more gracefully, but only time will tell how well this holds up over extended use.</p>\n<h2>Hacking the Portal: TheFlow0‚Äôs Findings</h2>\n<p>Earlier this year, hacker TheFlow0 managed to exploit the Portal, but Sony quickly patched the vulnerability in version 2.06. While this is disappointing for those of us who hoped to run homebrew apps on the device, TheFlow0 stated that he never intended to release the exploit publicly. He also noted that officially reporting security flaws to Sony only delays the inevitable patches by a few weeks. At some point, the exploit details will be disclosed publicly, but for now, Sony has locked down the device.</p>\n<h2>The Future of the Portal</h2>\n<p>The PlayStation Portal remains a mixed bag. On the one hand, it offers a fantastic ergonomic experience and a continually improving streaming quality. On the other hand, the HDR issue is a significant flaw that needs urgent attention.</p>\n<p>Sony has two potential solutions: either give users access to the Screen and Video settings during Remote Play or implement a backend fix that forces SDR output when streaming to non-HDR devices. Until then, Portal users will have to deal with frustrating workarounds.</p>\n<p>If you‚Äôre experiencing this issue, I‚Äôd love to hear about your setup‚Äîwhat kind of TV are you using, and are you seeing the same problems? Let me know in the comments, and let‚Äôs hope Sony addresses this sooner rather than later.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__video\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"314\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/8P-7_CwNNw4\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></iframe></figure>\n<hr>\n<p><span class=\"yt-core-attributed-string yt-core-attributed-string--white-space-pre-wrap\" dir=\"auto\"><span class=\"yt-core-attributed-string--link-inherit-color\" dir=\"auto\">PS Portal </span><span class=\"yt-core-attributed-string--link-inherit-color\" dir=\"auto\"><a class=\"yt-core-attributed-string__link yt-core-attributed-string__link--call-to-action-color\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&amp;redir_token=QUFFLUhqbEFZSHBNM3pFYTZyVXBQOFhuNTVYR1owcDZmQXxBQ3Jtc0ttdEZoMDE5dkx4VFRtdzFzZWZsVUtHU0lIWHVMdmtRVkh5MjNMbXhDT0l2S1Awc0VIZXp2Y3RTaVdVMkZPbjNsM1NaY05UZWM5NmN3bWxZclNHZ0F1N2drbm9pRkVfRlRpWnJKN3l4blFYVVUydWc3VQ&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Famzn.to%2F3VwoRi3&amp;v=z21i63eJUro\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" force-new-state=\"true\" tabindex=\"0\">https://amzn.to/3VwoRi3</a></span></span></p>",

Here's my initial impressions of the system and a few of the games I tried these last few weeks!</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p><!-- /wp:embed --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Just a few weeks ago I tweeted that I got a PSVR2, and I‚Äôve been trying out as many games as I could to give you my impressions of this system in 2024. To give some background I‚Äôve had quite a bit of experience in VR, this is my 3rd headset that I‚Äôve owned, I previously had PSVR1 and meta quest 2 which I only ever used as a PCVR Headset. I played all of Boneworks and most of half life Alyx, and on PSVR1 and I mostly played a lot of Firewall Zero Hour but as we all know that headset was not a super enjoyable experience compared to the competition that grew around it. I‚Äôve looked forward to trying this headset though ever since I edited the first Linus Tech Tips preview on the system around this time last year. With that said let's jump into my impressions</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Setup</h2>\n<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>I had some minor nitpicks with the setup process, the instructions were not super clear, I was trying to set up my play area while standing up in my playspace which kept erroring out, but it worked smoothly when I sat down on the couch.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Glasses</h2>\n<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>I also want to mention that why are the most accommodating headset I‚Äôve tried with glasses, I have a few different pairs and even some sports goggles that I would use but PSVR 2 fits all my glasses even these larger ones that I wear day to day, though I still prefer my smaller pair usually cause the prescription is not as strong and just lets my eyes relax a little more in the confined headset. The eye centering menus are really good, but I was a little disappointed at the amount of aberrations around the edges of the lenses still, but I think those are kind of unavoidable with these types of fresnel lenses.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Eyes</h2>\n<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>The eye tracking is pretty insane, the foveated rendering is basically impossible to make out while you are actually in the headset which is amazing. But yeah the eye tracking is super cool, in some instances you can use your eyes to navigate menus and such and it is just the craziest thing. And the screens are really nice, the OLED is awesome and gets super bright and contrasty and the framerates are very solid through all the games I tried. And as for the resolution I would say the pixels are small enough that you can quite make them out individually and see an obvious screen door, but not so small that you cant see the aliasing happening.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Controllers</h2>\n<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>The remotes are alright, on my quest 2 I had hand straps which I think should come standard with all VR headsets as they allow you to fully let go of controllers and it lends a lot to immersion. They are a bit confusing when you first glance or pick them up as to what hand they go in but I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll get used to it.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>I love the button on the bottom to view the exterior cameras, it;s a great way to jump in and out of the VR space besides pulling the entire headset off. Tracking seems about as good as quest 2 in my experience. I bought this unit for a really great price of $400, but the downside is that I don‚Äôt have the official included earbuds that clip into the back of the headset, but really any pair of earbuds work great and my hyperX headset actually fit over top of the whole headset so that was really great for immersion and probably better sound quality anyway. The single cable setup is awesome and I prefer having one wire over a potentially choppy wireless connection myself and it's miles better than thePSVR1 extra box and dozens of cables. And this way there's no battery life issues with the headset. The controller battery life is okay, I do prefer recharging to the double A‚Äôs of the quest 2 but I know that's up to the taste of each individual. I love having as many devices on USB C charging as possible.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>But let's talk about games. I tried a bunch of different games to get a wider feel for what works well on this system, I tried GT7 and walking dead saint and sinners of course, these are some higher profile games that I just needed to upgrade from the PS4 versions. And I tried some smaller indie games like Townsmen VR, Space Docker VR, and ForeVR Bowl.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Gran Turismo 7</h2>\n<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>GT7 just blew me away, it‚Äôs hard to show on video but the menus and up until the countdown to any race is all in the typical VR virtual display, and then it suddenly jump cuts into VR in the driver's seat and it‚Äôs one of the sickest and cleanest transitions ever. And I hadn‚Äôt played GT7 with the DualSense controller up to this point either. And I had a huge smile on my face the entire time. The way the mirrors actually work like they would in real life and the immersion was just incredible. I usually hate playing racing games in first person cause it‚Äôs too hard to see corners and such but this was obviously the most immersive way to feel like you were in the car and you could really spot the track and the turns but you just happen to be driving with a DualSense lol. I can see why this got so many people hooked and wanting to get steering wheel controllers.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Walking Dead</h2>\n<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Moving on to the Walking dead saint and sinners, this is a game I‚Äôve tried on every VR headset I owned, and it just keeps getting better each time. The OLED really made this game pop with its dark spooky sections and dimly lit environments. I don‚Äôt know what I can say about this game that hasn‚Äôt already been said, it‚Äôs just great and one of the best VR adventure games out there and I look forward to playing deeper into the game than I ever have with this headset. And maybe I‚Äôll check out the sequel one day if I ever get all the way through this one.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Townsmen VR</h2>\n<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Reminded me a lot of Black and White, but a more casual and carefree feeling since it‚Äôs not about being a literal god. Unfortunately this game made me very nauseous within 5-10 minutes of playing. I think partially due to how bright the art direction and gameworld is overall, but more so due to the floating head gameplay style and the way you navigate the game by grabbing the air around you to move and zoom in was just too much for my brain. But your mileage may vary as with all VR experiences.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Basically it‚Äôs like an RTS/city builder type game where you place various buildings and houses to create villagers that can do various tasks like collecting resources, construction, or combat if you get to some later stages. The fun thing is how you can zoom in and feel like you are standing in the middle of your town or be a god up in the sky and grab any character or object in the game world. You can grab animals, props, people to move them towards their objective or just throw them into the ocean or at each other. I was actually having issues where my omnipresent hands were causing mayhem without my intention but they luckily have a ghost-hand setting that makes your hands clip through things unless you intend to pick up them up, so that was perfect for me.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>I wish it didn‚Äôt give me such a headache so I could get a bit deeper in the game and get a stronger grasp on some of the later stages with combat and such. But that‚Äôs the unfortunate reality of VR games. I hadn‚Äôt tried a top-down style VR game like this before so I‚Äôm glad I gave it a shot at least.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Space Docker VR</h2>\n<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>I really got into this game. It reminded me a bit of No Mans Sky, but a much more focussed and tight experience focussed solely in the cockpit. You are collecting cargo containers and dropping them off. It‚Äôs a really fun mix of speed and precision and I was blown away by some of the highscore times people were getting. I live the sense of momentum and disorienting nature of the controls if you're not careful, but I felt like I was a pro in no time, slamming brake and spinning my ship every which way. At one point a cargo container was shooting off into deep space which gave avery unique sense of dread as I sped away from the space dock trying to match it‚Äôs speed and orientation, with homebase shrinking away in the distance. If you really enjoy flying games, but want something a bit more involved besides just flying around in a ship, this is probably a great choice.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">ForeVR Bowl</h2>\n<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Next I tried out ForeVR Bowl from the aptly named developer ForeVR Games. I actually enjoyed this quite a bit, though I don‚Äôt have any friends so I couldn‚Äôt try out the full multiplayer aspect of it. I think this is more made to be a social bowling experience based on the controls and features it gives you. Regardless, I was impressed by the atmosphere and the amount of detail and freedom it allows for while you're in the bowling alley because of this though. The game lets you walk around anywhere in the bowling alley, and while it does‚Äôt contribute to the gameplay generally, I think having that feeling of freedom and immersion in the space is so so important in a VR game like this. If you were just locked to a couple square meters in front of your bowling lane it would feel a lot more claustrophobic and wouldn't give you that feeling of being at a bowling alley. With all that said, I recommend playing some of your own music or something cause it‚Äôs kind of eerie to be in this bowling alley by yourself with a couple of animated floating heads and background chatter going on around you. Or just play with some friends online if you have any. There‚Äôs even a camera so you could take candids or selfies with other people. There were quite a few bowling alley options ranging from realistic classic looking levels to more zany fun ones like being on the moon. And there's hundreds of really cool unlockable and discoverable bowling ball options that are all quite mesmerizing to look at.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Controls were pretty good, some choppiness, might've had to do with my hand movements going out of sight. I didn't actually do a formal tutorial as far as I can tell so I'm not sure if I was bowling optimally for the game, but I was mostly trying to bowl as I would in real life and it seems to work out well as in the physics seem quite realistic. I think I was acting a bit more restricted in my movements and steps because of my limited playspace and I didn‚Äôt want to hit my TV but I feel like everything just feels natural, which is great. If you want a VR bowling game and you have friends out of town who also like to bowl, this would be a good place to look out.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Conclusion</h2>\n<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>So is PSVR2 worth it in 2024? I think if you can find a used unit for 400 or less and you already have a PS5, yes it is. But at full price it‚Äôs a tough sell. And there has been recent news that PSVR2 will be getting PC support sometime this year and it sounds like Sony removed a lot of software roadblocks in the recent update. And most likely they will be releasing some sort of USB dongle to make it work with PCs. So if you have a PC this might actually be an option you can consider soon, but I would say it depends on your budget and playspace, because it‚Äôs a low to mid-range priced VR headset, but it has eye tracking and OLED, but doesn‚Äôt have tracking base stations so you‚Äôll probably have to do some more research to figure out what you want and need. One thing about the lack of general support compared to PSVR1 that disappointed me is some of the ports that were left behind, like Minecraft and Hitman 3. I would love to give those a try again with this new headset.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>",

Particularly in regard to retro games like PSOne classics, PS3, and even PSP slash Vita games and the new PS Plus Premium program with classic titles being added each month.¬†</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>If you‚Äôre not familiar, the Cross Buy initiative started way back in 2012 with the PS3 and Vita, where Sony would basically bundle Vita and PS3 versions of games together into one purchase. PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale, Sly Cooper 4, Ratchet &amp; Clank: Full Frontal Assault, and Sound Shapes were some of the first titles to participate in this program. Since 2012 this program has greatly expanded and become the norm in many ways with Cross Play and Cross Save options available in many games and platforms.<br><br>And then the other key component in this video is PS Plus Premium. The new tiers of the PlayStation Plus subscription program that for all intents and purposes replaced the PS Now program in 2022 and subtly raised the prices of PS Plus subscriptions while giving the impression of more value. The premium tier specifically includes a larger catalog of Classic playstation games that you could stream or download while subscribed. What you might not know is that when these classic games are added to the PS4/PS5 stores on PS Plus, they are also listed and available to purchase outright, and the juicy part is that they honor existing digital purchases from legacy systems like PSP and PS1 Classics. Most of the PS2 and PS3 Classics that are on PS4/PS5 at the moment are actually just ports or remasters that already existed for PS4 specifically (example Jak, Parappa). And then at the end of last year, everyone thought Thrillville off the rails would be the first emulated PS2 release on the service, but it also turned out to just be another PSP port. So we‚Äôll have to wait and see if PS2 or PS3 ever get the same cross-buy treatment with direct emulated ports.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Enough about PS Plus, I want to talk about the cross buy shenanigans going on. As you may know, the browser storefront of the PS Store removed PSP, Vita, and PS3 titles from appearing way back in 2021. The PSN Store on PSP consoles was also shut down in that year. However, other than some annoying login and payment restrictions, you can still buy PSP games on a Vita or PS3 systems. Then on the PSP you can still access and download any digital purchases you made, even though the store doesn‚Äôt load.¬†</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Another thing on the backend that went along with these service restrictions is that developers can no longer access or change their pricing for their games on these legacy systems. So basically any PSP, Vita or PS3 game listing is just stuck in time as it was in 2021. This has some good and bad things. The good thing is that the prices are now frozen from inflation or exchange rate adjustments, but the downside is that they are never going on sale again, unless you count the loophole I will get into later. Which leads me to some interesting findings and examples of why you should still keep an eye on the PS Store on these older systems if you still have them working and like to buy your digital games.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>The most recent example that jumped out to me was Jet Moto 2, I had this game on PS1 growing up so I had already purchased it digitally a few months ago to play on Vita and PS3 via the PS Classic version. So lucky for me this appeared in my PS5 library as a owned game. Taking a look at the pricing of this game, if you buy it on a legacy system it only costs about $6, whereas if you buy it on PS4/PS5 it costs more than double! I checked a few other games like Hot Shots Golf 2, and it looks like PS1 Classics are all cheaper on the older systems.<br><br>Taking a look at some of the PSP ports it gets a bit more complicated. Resistance Retribution is more expensive on Vita/PS3. Meanwhile Killzone Liberation is slightly cheaper on PS3/Vita. Probably because resistance was a bit newer of a game on PSP? Hard to say. And then Syphon Filter Logans Shadow is not available standalone to buy on PS3/Vita for some reason, but it is bundled in a pack with Killzone Liberation which ends up much cheaper overall if you buy them both that way. I know that might be confusing but long story short, its worth looking at these old prices while they are still available. And yes, digital games you don't really own them and all that yada yada but that‚Äôs a whole other video discussion rabbit hole.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Lastly, if a game is cross-buy and has a native PS4 version, technically it can go on sale for older platforms. I‚Äôve seen this user SilentBun on Twitter who still posts Vita game discounts when they happen that are cross-buy with PS4 versions. And as the ultimate example of cross-buy compatibility I wanted to look at RETRO CITY RAMPAGE DX. Which is the last game that ever released on PSP in 2016. This game still goes on sale regularly for around $5 and if you buy it on a PS4, you will also get it on Vita, PS3, and PSP. That‚Äôs some great value and that‚Äôs the amazing reality of cross buy titles when developers are nice enough to implement it.¬†</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Anyways that‚Äôs what I wanted to talk about, hopefully one day we get PS2 and PS3 games properly added into this cross-buy mix, and less money grab ‚Äúremaster‚Äù ports like Red Dead Redemption on PS4 for full price... Thanks for watching if you‚Äôve made it this far, like and subscribe and all that good stuff. Let me know what games you want to see come to the PlayStation plus classics catalog.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>",

I'm going to be testing everything on the Galaxy S10 I think as a slightly<br>older Flagship it'll still perform as a pretty good baseline since It has a 1440p screen that also supports HDR. As I go through each app I'm going to be looking at the availability the pricing of any premium features the setup process for each of them as well as take<br>a look at the options available and then lastly I'll do a very quick and dirty latency test so you can take a look. I'll also give you the potential use case for each one and what I think the advantages of each are. I'll also really quickly try out the PlayStation Portal at the end because it's technically running Android so I'll just include that as well.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Before we even touch any of these apps though you'll need to make sure that your PS4 or PS5 is actually enabled for remote play in the settings, once that's ready let's get started with the official Remote Play app first.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=psplay.grill.com&amp;hl=en_CA&amp;gl=US\">Remote Play</a></h2>\n<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>It's available for free on the Android play store and the Apple App Store as well as downloadable for Windows or Mac OS from the PlayStation website. It's also available on Android TV. Of course, this one is the easiest to set up for remote play gaming once it's downloaded you'll just need to sign into your PSN account and it should be ready to go/ Although the PlayStation network has pretty regular login issues on Android in my experience. The options available in the official app<br>are fairly limited the on-screen controls are not customizable. the video quality does let you turn on and off HDR, change the resolution, and the frame rate but there's nothing else beyond that. Notably, bitrate is available on a lot of the other apps. There are some options for mobile data usage.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Another thing that's kind of strange is it does let you use the Android keyboard or an external keyboard but there's no support for non-official controllers other than that, so that means it only supports the Dualshock 4, the DualSense, as well as the Backbone. This app has been known to not work with many Android handheld devices from the likes of Retroid or AyaNeo or other devices like that. Even on Chrome OS which natively runs Android apps I couldn't get the Dualshock 4 or the DualSense controllers to work but that might have been a model specific case. So basically you should start by using this Official App if it's available on your platform but if anything doesn't work properly or you have a third-party controller, then you should probably look into the other options, which I'll get into now.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=psplay.grill.com&amp;hl=en_CA&amp;gl=US\">PSPlay</a></h2>\n<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>PSPlay is developed by grill2010 and it's available for about $5 to $10 depending on your exchange rate and region on the Android play store and the Apple App Store and Apple TVs. It's definitely more complicated to set up especially if you want to connect outside of your home network but but in many cases it is the best option for Android users because of the limited compatibility of the official app, but also just the sheer amount of options and customization that this app gives you. As I said it's a little bit more complicated to set up, you'll need to follow the instructions pretty closely. You'll need to find the PlayStation ID of your Playstation Network account following these instructions or there's <a href=\"https://psn.flipscreen.games/\">this website that I found</a> that actually gives you all the info you need for any of these apps. You just have to type in your PlayStation username and it'll give give you the number that you need and then go on your PS5 and Link the device type in that code should be good to go. But again unlike the official app, if you want to connect to your PS5 remotely outside of your own home network using this app, you're going to have to set up some port forwarding. It might be able to do it automatically for you but it doesn't work for me. It really depends on your router and access point setup.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Moving on from that, there are just so many options in this app. The settings list just goes on forever and you can go fairly deep into any of these options, especially the streaming settings. You can adjust bitrate, you can change the decoding method, you can even change the light bar colour of your controller! It does actually give you an option for haptic feedback and then as far as controllers are concerned you should be able to use any. I have this funny Bluetooth keyboard but unfortunately this phone was not letting me set that up as a game controller in any of these apps but any sort of Bluetooth gamepad should work and be able to map with this app. You can also use PSPlay as a controller. I would commend this application if you're having any sort of issues or controller issues with the official app or if you just really want more settings in regard to your connection or bandwidth or even just the on-screen controller gives you a lot more options. It also might just be a placebo or copium but some people online say that they have a smoother connection with this application maybe it has less processing overhead or something on the back end? I couldn't really tell in my day-to-day experience, but again we'll have the latency test at the end and we'll see if we can spot any difference</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><a href=\"https://git.sr.ht/~thestr4ng3r/chiaki\">Chiaki</a></h2>\n<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Moving on to our next app here, Chiaki is available for free for Android, Mac OS, Windows, and Linux (including the SteamDeck and even the Nintendo Switch)! This would obviously be a very complicated application to set up on some of those platforms but on Android it's not too bad, you just need to go to the The Source Hut website and download the APK, and then you can just side load it onto your Android phone. Again, I strongly recommend using that website that I mentioned in the PSPlay section; you just have to type in your username, and it'll give you your PSN ID number. And then for this app specifically, you'll need to do your code in Base-64 for some reason, but this website will give you that code, and you can just type that into the app.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>One nice thing was that this app actually picked up my PS5 on my home network before I even signed in or registered or anything so that was nice to see. So once I registered, it just worked. Taking a look at the settings here, there's not as many settings as PlayStation play but more settings than the official app. You can adjust bitrate and the resolution and the codec. You can actually export your settings so you could save your settings between phones. I don't think I saw that in the other apps, so that's pretty cool if you're switching devices a lot. It does say it has rumble support but I couldn't get that working. However, it's also not full haptic feedback with the PS5 DualSense controller. I think PSPlay and the official app support that. I don't actually see an option to adjust the on-screen button layout. Because of the more technical and hardcore installation process of this app, especially on some of the more weird platforms like Nintendo Switch, I would only recommend this app if you really want to use remote play on a weird platform like the Switch or the SteamDeck or if you're really cheap and this app is free on Android compared to PSPlay which is a couple of dollars. But otherwise, I think you're just better off trying one of the other apps that I've already talked about.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tmacdev.repl4y\">REPLAY</a></h2>\n<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Lastly, the next app is called REPLAY. This app is another alternative if you're not having a great experience with PSPlay or the official app or Chaiki. It's only available on Windows and Android, but unfortunately, it costs about ¬£6 or $10 CAD or more depending on the platform you want to buy it on and the platforms that you want to stream. The upside is that this app says it can support a lot of controllers out of the box, including steering wheels, believe it or not. But yeah, specifically in this case, it was ¬£6 for PS5 support when I purchased from the website. But if I tried to purchase it on the Android app itself, it was about $12, and then that would only let me use it on a PS5. I would still have to pay more if I wanted to use PS4. And then the console registration and account sign-in are almost identical to what you need to do with the PSPlay app, so you'll need your full PSN account ID number. And then looking at the settings here, they are fairly limited. You can edit the on-screen controls layout. It does let you turn on and off HDR and change the decoding process, and you can set the resolution and frame rate, some of those basic things. But otherwise, not a whole lot of settings compared to even Chaiki, but especially against PSPlay. Then another thing I found is that the initial connecting to the console is a bit slow compared to some of the other options in this video.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">PlayStation Portal</h2>\n<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Quickly taking a look at the PlayStation Portal, I think this thing just has a huge lack of settings, especially there's no ability to disable HDR on this device, and not even any options to set the quality preferences. I find that sometimes when the quality drops if you're using this device, it almost never returns back to the full 1080p (prior to patch 2.0.6). But if you just disconnect and reconnect the device, it just returns to full quality without any issues. And then the HDR thing really bothers me because if you don't want HDR to stream to the Portal, you're going to have to disable HDR on your PS5, even if it's in an HDR TV setup. Another really dumb thing about the Portal is you can't Remote Play to PS4; it only works with PS5, so all of these apps beat it in that regard as well. The only upside of the Portal is that it works really easily out of the box, and you get the full haptic feedback dual sense experience. But if you just want pure software functionality and options, basically any of these Remote Play apps are better.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Latency Comparison</h2>\n<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>So as I said, here's a quick and dirty latency test you can just quickly compare. Of course, this is on a home network; connecting remotely has so many variables to it I don't really see the point of testing that.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:image {\"id\":747,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"linkDestination\":\"media\"} --></p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://kacboy.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/image.png\"><figure class=\"wp-image-747\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://kacboy.com/blog/media/posts/20/image.png\" alt=\"\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"https://kacboy.com/blog/media/posts/20/responsive/image-xs.png 300w ,https://kacboy.com/blog/media/posts/20/responsive/image-sm.png 480w ,https://kacboy.com/blog/media/posts/20/responsive/image-md.png 768w ,https://kacboy.com/blog/media/posts/20/responsive/image-lg.png 1024w\"></figure></a></figure>\n<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Looking at the results, I found that the PlayStation portal has a lot of ghosting in this comparison and that's because it's the only LCD display in these clips whereas the Galaxy S10 is an HDR OLED screen. Surprisingly, REPLAY was actually the fastest and most consistent on average of all of the apps with Chiaki a close second. The portal was the slowest but the ghosting effect made it kind of hard to judge so I wouldn't say that's very definitive but PSPlay was actually the slowest app on average. It was a lot less consistent and had a lot more variance in each test clip so I would say REPLAY and Chiaki are actually the best for latency, and then PSPlay and the official app are both kind of close in third and fourth place.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>In conclusion, I think PS Play has by far the most options and nitty-gritty settings to mess with. If I had to rank these I would put:</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:list {\"ordered\":true} --></p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ol><!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>PSPlay</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ol>\n<li>Chaiki</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ol>\n<li>Official App</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ol>\n<li>REPLAY</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:list --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Just cause I think the price on REPLAY is quite steep and having to pay for each system is just kind of ridiculous compared to the other options out there. That's my personal ranking, hopefully this has been a little bit helpful to you in getting to know what options are available for Remote Play on Android.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>PSN ID Grabber <a href=\"https://psn.flipscreen.games/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">https://psn.flipscreen.games/</a><br>Official Remote Play <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=psplay.grill.com&amp;hl=en_CA&amp;gl=US\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">https://play.google.com/store/apps/de...</a> <br>PSPlay <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=psplay.grill.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">https://play.google.com/store/apps/de...</a> <br>Chiaki <a href=\"https://git.sr.ht/~thestr4ng3r/chiaki\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">https://git.sr.ht/~thestr4ng3r/chiaki</a> <br>REPLAY <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tmacdev.repl4y\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">https://play.google.com/store/apps/de...</a></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>",

And with the recent amount of layoffs and studio closures, it seems like stories like these have only become more commonplace and I already feel like I‚Äôll need to make another video like this in the near future.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Zipper Interactive</h2>\n<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Starting with Zipper Interactive, which was founded in 1995 in Washington state, they first made a name for themselves working on various mech and airplane combat games on PC. However, they eventually became most known as the team behind the SOCOM franchise on PS2, which received critical and commercial success for many years. Because of this series and its exceptional usage of the PS2 network functionality, they were bought by Sony shortly before the PS3 was released in 2006. Unfortunately, the PS3 generation and basically their entire tenure as a first-party studio REALLY did not go well for them. Their first PS3 game was called MAG and it came out in 2010 and just had mediocre reception overall, but it was quickly followed by the LONG awaited SOCOM 4 in 2011, but that game came out the first week of the great PSN outage and was all but dead on arrival because of that. Lastly, they put out Unit 13 in 2012 on the Vita which was a perfectly serviceable Vita action game, but as we all know, the Vita was also not a great platform to release the hit game they desperately needed at that point. Sony shut them down the same month that Unit 13 was released. RIP Zipper and SOCOM</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Evolution Studios</h2>\n<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Moving on to my personal favourite in this video, Evolution Studios was a British studio founded in 1999 and they were always focused on developing racing games. Their debut game, \"World Rally Championship,\" came out for PS2 in 2001 and was co-published by Sony. It was well-received and helped cement the company in the racing space as they continued to make yearly sequels until 2005. With the PS3 launching, they switched it up and created Motorstorm, which wasn‚Äôt actually a launch title but was definitely one of the more notable games around the system‚Äôs launch.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>The following year, Sony finally purchased them outright for about 33 million USD. They continued the MotorStorm series throughout the PS3 generation, but they finally hit a bump in the road with the third entry in the series, Motorstorm Apocalypse. The game was originally scheduled to be released in March 2011, but at the last minute, it was delayed worldwide due to the Tohoku earthquake and tsunami that struck Japan on March 11, 2011. The game contained many scenes of huge natural disasters and collapsing cities that would've been very insensitive or inappropriate to the market in the wake of the disaster. Evolution Studios had to backtrack on the whole game and make drastic changes to the game's content. A revised version of the game was eventually released in Europe and North America in March and May, respectively, but it was never actually released in Japan, as far as I could gather. To top it off, the game also took a huge blow in the places it did release, as Sony severely decreased the amount of marketing for the game, so as to avoid controversy or spend twice the budget because of these delays. Overall, it was just really unfortunate timing and the MotorStorm series was pretty much dead after that.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>For the last time, Evolution switched gears and created Driveclub, which seemed like a strange decision that, on the outside, looked like direct competition for the very well-established Gran Turismo series. The game launched on PS4 in 2015 to a very rocky launch riddled with server issues and other technical problems. The game got a lot of negative press since it was very reliant on network connectivity, which sounds like a foreshadowing of GT7 to me. Despite their efforts to fix the game, the damage was done and Sony announced in March 2016 that it would be shutting down Evolution Studios. It‚Äôs reported that a lot of the team moved to work at Codemasters, and a lot of their DNA can be felt in OnRush, which came out in 2018.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Japan Studio</h2>\n<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>The last studio I wanted to touch on hasn‚Äôt necessarily shut down in the same way as the others but is definitely truncated to some degree. Japan Studio was the first first-party development team for PlayStation, founded in 1993, not long after the console division itself was formed inside Sony. Their first big hit was Jumping Flash back in 1995 but looking back, they‚Äôve really been around for so long that they‚Äôve developed a TON of games in a wide variety of genres and were even sizable enough to partition into various internal teams throughout the years. Some notable internal divisions included Team Ico, who made Shadow of the Colossus, Project Siren or Team Gravity who created the Gravity Rush games and of course, Team Asobi, who I will get into more later. Some of their other most highly acclaimed game series include Parappa the Rappa, Patapon, LocoRoco, and Ape Escape.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>More recently, Team Asobi has been at the forefront of Japan Studio creating technical demos for various PlayStation hardware launches. On PS4, they released the PlayRoom to showcase the PS Camera, followed by Playroom VR and Astro Bot Rescue Mission to demonstrate the first PSVR headset. Rescue Mission in particular was widely praised for its innovative use of the PSVR platform and made AstroBot something of a new mascot for the brand. The next Asobi game called Astro‚Äôs Playroom launched pre-installed on the PS5 to showcase the new features of the DualSense controller, again to critical praise.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Unfortunately in 2021, it was announced that Japan Studio would be dissolving down to just Team Asobi after various directors of other internal teams seemed to be trickling away from the studio throughout 2020. There appear to be a number of reasons for this shift, the most significant of which is that PlayStation had been moving towards a more western focus in the late 2010s.As well, the studio is reported to have just gotten too unsustainable and inefficient with so many internal teams that were not producing games as successfully as the rest of the first-party catalog. When you look at the sales results for some of their higher profile games of the last few years, stuff like Last Guardian, Gravity Rush 2, and Knack 2, they just didn‚Äôt sell a lot of copies in the grand scheme of PS studios. Studio Japan was estimated to be 800 people in 2021, while Bluepoint, who did the Shadow of the Colossus remake, is supposedly about 70 people. Studio Japan‚Äôs Last Guardian took about 10 years to develop and it only marginally outsold Shadow of the Colossus remake, which only took 2-3 years to develop. Granted it is a remake of an old Japan studio game but these sales numbers are not very favorable to the huge team size of Japan Studio. Gravity Rush 2 and Knack 2 are both sequels and they sold much worse than Last Guardian. So it makes sense to me that Team Asobi is now estimated to be about the same size as Bluepoint after the restructuring. AstroBot and Team Asobi still have a lot of positive buzz and potential and the executives at PlayStation were able to pick up on this.<br><br>‚Äì</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sources-playstation-is-winding-down-sony-japan-studio\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sources-playstation-is-winding-down-sony-japan-studio</a><br><a href=\"https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sources-playstation-is-winding-down-sony-japan-studio/\">https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sources-playstation-is-winding-down-sony-japan-studio/</a><br><a href=\"https://www.sony.com/en_us/SCA/company-news/press-releases/sony-computer-entertainment-america-inc/2006/sony-computer-entertainment-acquires-zipper-interactive-developer-of-top-selling-socom-us-navy-seals-franchise.html\">https://www.sony.com/en_us/SCA/company-news/press-releases/sony-computer-entertainment-america-inc/2006/sony-computer-entertainment-acquires-zipper-interactive-developer-of-top-selling-socom-us-navy-seals-franchise.html</a><br><a href=\"https://www.gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2012/03/30/sony-closes-zipper-interactive.aspx\">https://www.gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2012/03/30/sony-closes-zipper-interactive.aspx</a><br><a href=\"https://www.sony.com/en_us/SCA/company-news/press-releases/sony-computer-entertainment-america-inc/2007/sony-computer-entertainment-acquires-evolution-studios-and-bigbig-studios.html\">https://www.sony.com/en_us/SCA/company-news/press-releases/sony-computer-entertainment-america-inc/2007/sony-computer-entertainment-acquires-evolution-studios-and-bigbig-studios.html</a><br><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/motorstorm-apocalypse-european-release-delayed/1100-6303681/\">https://www.gamespot.com/articles/motorstorm-apocalypse-european-release-delayed/1100-6303681/</a><br><a href=\"https://www.cgmagonline.com/news/motorstorm-apocalypse-gets-another-release-date/\">https://www.cgmagonline.com/news/motorstorm-apocalypse-gets-another-release-date/</a><br><a href=\"https://www.destructoid.com/disaster-motorstorm-apocalypse-canceled-in-japan-forever/\">https://www.destructoid.com/disaster-motorstorm-apocalypse-canceled-in-japan-forever/</a><br><a href=\"https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sources-playstation-is-winding-down-sony-japan-studio/\">https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sources-playstation-is-winding-down-sony-japan-studio/</a><br><a href=\"https://www.thegamer.com/playstation-studios-website-removed-japan-studio-replaced-team-asobi/\">https://www.thegamer.com/playstation-studios-website-removed-japan-studio-replaced-team-asobi/</a><br><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/lse8s6/sources_playstation_is_winding_down_sony_japan/\">https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/lse8s6/sources_playstation_is_winding_down_sony_japan/</a><br><a href=\"https://kotaku.com/sony-shuts-down-driveclub-developer-evolution-studios-1766375507\">https://kotaku.com/sony-shuts-down-driveclub-developer-evolution-studios-1766375507</a><br><a href=\"https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/sony-shuts-down-i-driveclub-i-developer-evolution-studios\">https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/sony-shuts-down-i-driveclub-i-developer-evolution-studios</a><br><a href=\"https://www.gamesindustry.biz/sony-confirms-closure-of-evolution-studio\">https://www.gamesindustry.biz/sony-confirms-closure-of-evolution-studio</a><br><a href=\"https://www.sony.com/content/sony/en/en_us/SCA/company-news/press-releases/sony-computer-entertainment-america-inc/2007/sony-computer-entertainment-acquires-evolution-studios-and-bigbig-studios.html\">https://www.sony.com/content/sony/en/en_us/SCA/company-news/press-releases/sony-computer-entertainment-america-inc/2007/sony-computer-entertainment-acquires-evolution-studios-and-bigbig-studios.html</a><br><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/18/22984770/gran-turismo-7-down-outage-back-online\">https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/18/22984770/gran-turismo-7-down-outage-back-online</a><br><a href=\"https://racinggames.gg/gran-turismo/gran-turismo-7-monthly-updates-continue-to-disappoint/\">https://racinggames.gg/gran-turismo/gran-turismo-7-monthly-updates-continue-to-disappoint/</a><br><a href=\"https://www.carthrottle.com/news/driveclub-comes-under-tremendous-pressure-after-failed-launch\">https://www.carthrottle.com/news/driveclub-comes-under-tremendous-pressure-after-failed-launch</a></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>",

And now they are bringing the game to PS4, not PS5, for nearly full price with minor visual upgrades and no multiplayer on August 17. This is a trend that‚Äôs gone on for most of the PS4 generation and it‚Äôs really a middle finger to fans who were into the PS ecosystem for the PS3 generation.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>This latest port of Red Dead stuck out to me because I own Red Dead Redemption 1 on PS3 digitally and it‚Äôs remained on my system all these years since it was the only PlayStation console where it was playable. But this ‚Äúnew‚Äù version on PS4 is arguably downgraded from the original and I would have to buy it again to play it! As far as I can tell the only upgrade is that it‚Äôs potentially a higher resolution but with the same 30fps lock as on PS3, so the improvements in this case would be hardly noticeable in a typical TV gaming setup.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Basically, since the launch of the PS4, games have been getting ported from PS3 as ‚Äòremasters‚Äô, typically with minor graphical upgrades and more often than not, a removal of multiplayer modes. Uncharted, God of War 3, The Last of Us Remastered, Heavy Rain and Beyond Two Souls, Destroy All Humans 2, the original Modern Warfare 2, and Mass Effect all got ported. And with the exception of The Last of Us, had their multiplayer components removed on PS4. But The Last of Us later had its multiplayer removed when it was ported to PS5 as Part 1 so the point kind of still stands. And probably the biggest insult of all was the GTA trilogy, which came out shortly after the original ported versions were delisted and the AI-enhanced abomination that was the definitive trilogy came out for full price.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>I'm just frustrated that they keep doing these ports without acknowledging the fans who purchased these games on PS3, which is also still up and running and you could buy many of these games digitally on the PS3 store if you so desired.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Meanwhile, on Xbox Store, You can go and buy the original game with 4k 60fps enhancement for a much cheaper price right now because of their backwards compatibility. Unfortunately, Sony is the market leader right now which means they don't have to make consumer-friendly moves to promote their brand.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>I also dug up this old support page from the early PS4 days and it was a thing that PS3 versions of certain games were upgradeable to PS4 for no extra charge. Including if you bought a physical copy. However, it looks like this was only supported by 5 third-party titles. I think The Last of Us set a very greedy precedent for Sony and the industry and we the consumers have been worse off for it ever since.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>On the positive side, with the expansion of the PS+ Premium classic catalogue, Sony has actually been honouring people‚Äôs existing purchases of PSP and PS1 games from the PSP, Vita, and PS3 stores. For example, the new port of Killzone Liberation was showing up as purchased and downloadable on PS4 and 5 for users who bought the game way back in the day on the PSP or Vita. So things may be starting to move in a better direction and hopefully this trend of directly porting old PSN games instead of debatable ‚Äòremasters‚Äô¬† becomes the norm and expands into PS2 and PS3 games down the line.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>‚Äì</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://blog.playstation.com/2022/05/16/all-new-playstation-plus-game-lineup-assassins-creed-valhalla-demons-souls-ghost-of-tsushima-directors-cut-nba-2k22-and-more-join-the-service\">https://blog.playstation.com/2022/05/16/all-new-playstation-plus-game-lineup-assassins-creed-valhalla-demons-souls-ghost-of-tsushima-directors-cut-nba-2k22-and-more-join-the-service</a><br><a href=\"https://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/51ok43a4521a8o/red-dead-redemption-and-undead-nightmare-coming-to-nintendo-switch-and?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=o_social&amp;utm_campaign=rdr1_announcement_switchps4-20230807\">https://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/51ok43a4521a8o/red-dead-redemption-and-undead-nightmare-coming-to-nintendo-switch-and?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=o_social&amp;utm_campaign=rdr1_announcement_switchps4-20230807</a><br><a href=\"https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/legal/playstation-3-to-playstation-4-digital-upgrade-programme-full-instructions\">https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/legal/playstation-3-to-playstation-4-digital-upgrade-programme-full-instructions</a><br><a href=\"https://www.xbox.com/en-CA/games/store/red-dead-redemption/bwklfhwt7dhc\">https://www.xbox.com/en-CA/games/store/red-dead-redemption/bwklfhwt7dhc</a></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>",

It was a pretty obscure program that I was fortunate enough to have participated in and there‚Äôs not a lot of information on it, partially because it was supposed to be a small program and I think mostly because the name is just awful for any sort of SEO and word of mouth. Whether it was stylized as two words ‚Äúon PS‚Äù or on.playstation, or OnPlaystation with no space, it was inconsistently named and really did not make it an easy thing to search for.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Basically, On PlayStation was a rewards program intended for retail workers to expand their knowledge of the PlayStation ecosystem. And as far as I know, it was an active program in Canada and the US only. Basically by reading and watching PlayStation content which was usually just stuff pulled from PS Blog and completing quizzes based on said content, you could win prizes and PSN store content.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>But again, this was mostly intended for retail workers and I think was mostly a grandfathered program going back to the PS3 generation, when they still used to have game-demo units in brick-and-mortar stores. It was an incentive for interested retail workers to become more knowledgeable and helpful in regard to PlayStation content and be able to sell and promote the brand‚Äôs products more effectively. I‚Äôm not totally sure how many people were actually in the program but I‚Äôd say it was in the high hundreds or low thousands.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Anyone could sign up to the site but to actually participate you need to be verified. Say for example you worked at Best Buy or Gamestop, you would be able to apply to be verified as a relevant retail worker by sending in a paystub or employment letter or whatever to PlayStation. Then once you got approved you could start gaining points by going through the content and quizzes on the site. The content usually revolved around new first-party titles and larger third-party games, as well as whatever new hardware was being released at the time like controllers or peripherals. The quizzes would ask things like age ratings, general features of games and hardware, or trivia like release dates and so on. It was nothing too difficult cbut they usually did limit the number of tries you could use on each quiz so you couldn‚Äôt just click things willy-nilly. The interface was pretty poor as well so it was quite a pain when you got things incorrect too.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>The earlier version of On PS offered credits as rewards for completing content, the credits could then be redeemed on limited amounts of physical or digital prizes. I managed to get this cool Order 1886 mug back then, as well as a physical copy of Minecraft PS4. If I remember correctly it took a LOT of work to get enough credits for anything worthwhile.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Then around 2018 is when the program got a revamp and moved to a new backend on the Zunos learning platform. This new platform offered points for completing quizzes and reading content almost the same, but instead of a redeemable store of physical and digital rewards, they ran digital-only lotteries for any members who had a certain amount of points or had completed specific quizzes. Usually giving away a couple hundred copies of the latest first-party game or PS+ subscriptions. I won a lot of games over the years, stuff like Spiderman Miles Morales, Sackboys Big Adventure, and even GT7 more recently. As well, I haven‚Äôt had to pay for PS+ for about 3 or 4 years because of this program.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>When they finally announced the program was shutting down in the summer of 2022¬† it was still unclear what exactly PS Stars was at the time so it was a pretty disappointing announcement overall. Only in hindsight a few after PS Stars fully launched did the potential relationship of these two announcements click together in my mind and I‚Äôd guess that the OnPlayStation team was absorbed into PS Stars, which has been much more successful and accessible than OnPS ever was. I especially love how PS Stars rewards you for just playing games as you normally would, rather than going out of your way to click around an app doing grindy quizzes in the hopes of having a chance to win rewards.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Anyways that‚Äôs all for this video, hopefully, that was an enlightening little look at what I believe was a pretty unknown piece of PlayStation history and a sort of predecessor to PS Stars.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>‚Äì</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://on.playstation.com\">https://on.playstation.com</a><br><a href=\"https://onplaystation.zunos.com/SignUp/Register?k=68a07a45-8016-429d-b4dd-32930444f60d#/form\">https://onplaystation.zunos.com/SignUp/Register?k=68a07a45-8016-429d-b4dd-32930444f60d#/form</a></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>",

I‚Äôve always taken advantage of PS Plus over the years and have amassed an insanely large collection of nearly 600 games. I also was a big fan of PS Now. I've tried streaming PS3 games a few times and it was totally fine for me, but it was a really exceptional service when they started allowing game downloads.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Anyways, moving on to the new relaunch of the service back in June, basically PS Plus as we knew it stayed the same as the essential tier, whereas PS Now was moved on top of it and split up into 2 more expensive tiers. The extra tier gives access to what was the PS Now downloadable catalog, while the premium tier allows for cloud streaming of the not-downloadable games, and boasts additional access to retro titles and game trials.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>However, if you read the comments on PS Blog over the last few months, while there has been a lot of positive reception, the premium tier sounds like it‚Äôs been VERY disappointing for most players especially for those interested in the retro games catalog. The PS2 games made available so far were already purchasable games or were already included in PS Now, and only 3 PSP games have been added to the service since launch. In October the ‚Äòclassics‚Äô catalog was basically a bunch of Yakuza PS4 games, debatable classics but definitely not retro releases. And in that same month, GTA Vice City Definitive Edition was part of the Extra catalog, despite being way more of a retro game so that really didn‚Äôt make much sense.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Then in November they added several Ratchet and Clank games, but they are only available in PS3 cloud streaming form. So for a lot of users they basically got no retro games that month because streaming does not work great for a lot of people. It's really sad because Ratchet &amp; Clank is an active first party series celebrating its 20th anniversary. So these sorts of games should be the top priority to bring forward modern systems.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Speaking of active first party series, in the wake of God of War Ragnarok I also wanted to try playing the original God of War trilogy recently to get a better grasp of the overall series since I had never actually played them, but turns out none of them are available on PS4 or PS5. For some reason only GOW3 was brought forward in 2015. And the first 2 games and the PSP entries aren't even scary PS3 cell-processor games so there's really no reason why they are not ported over as PS2 classics and PSP classics, let alone remasters. I think it‚Äôs really silly that I can‚Äôt play God of War, PlayStation's flagship franchise from beginning to end on their currently supported systems of choice. There shouldn't be any licensing red tape for these sorts of actual classics not to be on the service! The classic catalog for Premium users has just continuously felt like a LOT of squandered opportunities so far.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Going back to the Ratchet and Clank games, I think it‚Äôs worth mentioning that just over a year ago Sony wanted to shut down the PS3 store, but here they are, still relying on the system they wanted to leave behind. In some ways I wish they did kill the PS3 and Vita stores because they might have been doing more to bring the unavailable catalog forward at this point. Oh and of course there's no Vita games coming to PS Plus because Sony likes to pretend it doesn't exist even though there's an abandoned Uncharted game just sitting there that most people haven't played that they could just re-release for PS5 players if they really cared to.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>On the 1st we got new rumors about December's classic titles, and apparently they will be adding SW Battlefront 2 as a retro title, but it‚Äôs the PSP version! While it‚Äôs said to be a great game, the PS2 battlefront 2 is a legendary game and would easily be a better choice. But from what I‚Äôve read about this decision is that apparently Sony does not have a great PS2 emulator, which has definitely been true on PS4 in my experience. I recently played all the Jak games on PS4 pro and they run really terribly.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Guess what I‚Äôm saying is that it seems like the Extra tier is actually the better tier because the downloadable modern games Sony‚Äôs been adding to the service at that level are just plain better than whats been added to the Premium tier so far.
