            "content_html": "<p>In a surprise turn of events, Uncharted 2 multiplayer has been revived! Thanks to a dedicated user named Force, players can once again dive into the nostalgic battles of this classic game. If you've been longing to revisit Uncharted 2's online multiplayer, now's your chance.</p>\n<h2>The History of Uncharted 2's Multiplayer Shutdown</h2>\n<p>Back in 2019, Sony officially shut down the multiplayer servers for Uncharted 2, Uncharted 3, and The Last of Us on PS3. While The Last of Us Remastered on PS4 still maintains its factions multiplayer mode, and Uncharted 3 multiplayer was brought back through LAN networking solutions, Uncharted 2 was left in the dark. Due to its requirement for a network handshake and lack of built-in LAN functionality, reviving the game seemed nearly impossible‚Äîuntil now.</p>\n<h2>The Revival of Uncharted 2 Multiplayer</h2>\n<p>A user named Force has successfully restored Uncharted 2's multiplayer servers, making it possible for players to enjoy custom matches once again. He revealed that the necessary network data and files had already been captured five years ago, yet no one had managed to bring it back online‚Äîuntil now.</p>\n<p>I was fortunate enough to test his server solution firsthand, and let me tell you, the experience was surreal. If you still own a PS3 and a copy of Uncharted 2 (digital or physical), you can now hop back into multiplayer and co-op modes. Even better, Force is working on an RPCS3 emulator version, which will allow PC players to join in the future.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__video\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"314\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/qyHfMbsKG74\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></iframe></figure>\n<h2>How to Get Started</h2>\n<p>If you're eager to jump back into Uncharted 2 multiplayer, here‚Äôs how you can set up access to the revived servers:</p>\n<h3>Step 1: Join the Discord Community</h3>\n<p>To get access to the server, you‚Äôll need to join Force‚Äôs Discord server (linked below). There, you can get your PlayStation Network (PSN) name approved and receive the necessary DNS IP address to connect to the multiplayer servers.</p>\n<h3>Step 2: Configure Your PS3 Network Settings</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>On your PS3, navigate to <strong>Settings &gt; Network Settings</strong>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Select <strong>Settings and Connection Status List</strong> and take note of your current IP address, subnet mask, and default router address.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Go to <strong>Internet Connection Settings</strong>, select <strong>Custom</strong>, and choose either <strong>Wired</strong> or <strong>Wireless</strong> based on your setup.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>When you reach the <strong>IP Address Setting</strong> section, choose <strong>Manual</strong> and enter the details you noted earlier.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>For <strong>Primary DNS</strong>, enter the DNS IP address provided in the Discord server.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>(Optional) If you experience connection issues, set the <strong>Secondary DNS</strong> to <strong>8.8.8.8</strong>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Save the settings and test your internet connection.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If your internet and PSN connections are successful, you should be ready to launch Uncharted 2 multiplayer!</p>\n<h3>Troubleshooting Tips</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Game Freezing at the Loading Screen?</strong> Go to <strong>Game Data Utility</strong>, delete Uncharted 2‚Äôs game data, and reinstall all updates.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Syncing Live Data Takes Too Long?</strong> The first connection might take a while, but subsequent attempts should be much faster.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>DLC Availability Issues?</strong> It varies by PSN region, so try accessing the PlayStation Store directly instead of the in-game store.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What to Expect in Multiplayer</h2>\n<p>Once you're in, you‚Äôll find that your rank, leaderboards, and trophy progress are still there from 2019. At the moment, only custom games are available, so you‚Äôll need to invite other players to join matches. However, matchmaking is on the roadmap for future updates!</p>\n<p>Additionally, cinema mode works, meaning players can once again create montages and machinima content. This is a fantastic opportunity to relive the golden days of Uncharted 2 multiplayer with a fresh community.</p>\n<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>\n<p>Never in my wildest dreams did I think I‚Äôd be playing Uncharted 2 multiplayer again, but here we are! A massive shoutout to Force and the community working behind the scenes to make this happen. If you‚Äôre a fan of the series, dust off your PS3 and dive back into one of the best multiplayer experiences ever created.</p>\n<h3>Join the Action</h3>\n<p>To start playing, join the <strong>Discord community</strong> (link below) and follow the steps to set up your connection. Hope to see you in the game!</p>\n<figure class=\"post__video\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"314\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q1fVvjaXH90\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></iframe></figure>\n<hr>\n<p>Uncharted 2 Revived <a href=\"https://discord.gg/9pJrhnhucz\">https://discord.gg/9pJrhnhucz</a><br>Reddit Announcement <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/unchartedmultiplayer/comments/1jfbpm5/uncharted_2_revived_no_gatekeeping_just_pure/\">https://www.reddit.com/r/unchartedmultiplayer/comments/1jfbpm5/uncharted_2_revived_no_gatekeeping_just_pure/</a><br>Uncharted 3 Reloaded <a href=\"https://discord.com/invite/jtvQ7sQcZS\">https://discord.com/invite/jtvQ7sQcZS</a><br>Retro Fighters Defender Controller <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3yNFA7w\">https://amzn.to/3yNFA7w</a></p>",

In this guide, I‚Äôll show you step-by-step how to do this without re-encoding your movie files, saving you time and hassle.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__video\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"314\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/KY38deZrl7s?t=240s\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></iframe></figure>\n<h2>What You‚Äôll Need</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>PSVR2 headset</strong> and <strong>PC adapter</strong> (set up and configured for SteamVR)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>A 3D Blu-ray movie</strong> (example: Top Gun 3D)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>A Blu-ray drive for your PC</strong></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>MakeMKV</strong> (to rip the Blu-ray to an MKV file)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>BD3D2MK3D</strong> (to convert the MKV file to a side-by-side 3D format)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>AVISynth+</strong> (a required supplementary tool for BD3D2MK3D)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Bigscreen Beta</strong> (a free VR app on Steam that allows you to watch movies in a virtual theater)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>VLC Media Player</strong> (to play the 3D movie)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Step 1: Rip the 3D Blu-ray with MakeMKV</h2>\n<p>MakeMKV is a free tool that lets you create digital copies of your physical Blu-ray discs. Here‚Äôs how:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Insert your 3D Blu-ray disc into your Blu-ray drive.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Open <strong>MakeMKV</strong> and select the Blu-ray drive.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In the options, <strong>make sure to check the 3D video track</strong>, as it may not be selected by default.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Start the ripping process. <strong>This will take some time</strong> (around an hour or more, depending on your PC and Blu-ray drive).</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Step 2: Convert the MKV File to Side-by-Side 3D Format</h2>\n<p>Once you have your MKV file, you need to convert it into a side-by-side format, which is required for VR playback.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Open <strong>BD3D2MK3D</strong> and drag your newly created MKV file into the program.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Remove any unnecessary audio and subtitle tracks to save space.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Uncheck the ‚Äúhalf-quality‚Äù option if you want <strong>full-quality 3D video</strong> (note: this increases processing time).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Start the conversion. <strong>This can take about an hour</strong>, even on a high-performance computer.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>üí° <em>You‚Äôll also need AVISynth+ installed for this process to work.</em></p>\n<h2>Step 3: Set Up Your Virtual Cinema in Bigscreen Beta</h2>\n<p>With your 3D movie ready, it‚Äôs time to experience it in VR.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Open <strong>SteamVR</strong> and make sure your PSVR2 is properly connected.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Launch <strong>Bigscreen Beta</strong> from your Steam library.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Choose a theater environment (I prefer the fancy home theater setup, but you can pick any you like).</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Step 4: Play Your 3D Movie in VR</h2>\n<p>Now, let‚Äôs get the movie playing in full 3D:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Open VLC Media Player</strong> and load your converted side-by-side 3D movie.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Go full-screen in VLC so it fills the Bigscreen virtual theater.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In Bigscreen Beta, press <strong>R3</strong> on your controller to open the settings.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Select the <strong>3D mode option</strong> and set it to <strong>side-by-side (SBS)</strong>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Your movie should now display correctly in stereoscopic 3D!</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>\n<p>While this process may seem a bit complex, it‚Äôs currently the best free method to watch 3D Blu-ray movies on the PSVR2. Thanks to MakeMKV, BD3D2MK3D, and Bigscreen Beta, you can enjoy your 3D content in a large virtual cinema <strong>without any paid software</strong>.</p>\n<p>If Sony ever enables native 3D Blu-ray support on PS5, this method won‚Äôt be necessary‚Äîbut for now, this is the best solution available.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">MakeMKV</span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&amp;redir_token=QUFFLUhqbGZVVVFabXZtRVY4TVg3dEpjQkdTWmlJYVVqQXxBQ3Jtc0tuRm44MkhkNlhtQWdGS2k3NnFyWkhTYlJQV0dqZXNBZUw2S29TcU5hMHNjQW1YN01iUnVMcjdaZk9XMXhUaDJsS19fV0ljb2N2cnhfQ1BxMkJTWkJNaWdDTUFkMEZUWS1Sc2lPRHBQUjBlaThxdDRsYw&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.makemkv.com%2F&amp;v=KY38deZrl7s\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></a><a href=\"https://www.makemkv.com/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">https://www.makemkv.com/</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br></span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Bigscreen</span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&amp;redir_token=QUFFLUhqbFlfVDNfUXBMbUxtU1ZleXRIbTFuLUV6YlZwZ3xBQ3Jtc0ttSDd4cThlSzdNRUNrSFdsQXVOOW92eFN0U2NjSjNkQ0h1SjBieTgxcUQ5d2NEaHROdTFkcDZad2tEVklHYUxYeGNMOXNKMjdfX2dlRGd5RTlGTkktVFBKQ3FNMnNQVzBfMWNrZjlsbVEwcTRzaGFXbw&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F457550%2FBigscreen_Beta%2F&amp;v=KY38deZrl7s\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></a><a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/45%E2%80%A6\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">https://store.steampowered.com/app/45‚Ä¶</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br></span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> BD3D2MK3D</span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&amp;redir_token=QUFFLUhqbUZMTExzNTFHYVdoMDZqbHNGY0hZS2JodEJSUXxBQ3Jtc0trS0JLN1llcEU2Mno2ODRtd0FxMFBycTFJVHJQc0QyOXpib2gtcDE4TmNGM1NDUFBoQXRVYWJ5MEpIQVBuNVFtNFI1QjhDOHYySkNScVJYbWtOSzk2SXBoblJpLUZmUjZOb1EzcTRyRkVFeW1NVTVSNA&amp;q=http%3A%2F%2Fforum.doom9.org%2Fshowthread.php%3Ft%3D170828&amp;v=KY38deZrl7s\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> http://forum.doom9.org/showthread.php...</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">VLC</span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&amp;redir_token=QUFFLUhqbm5XNHRDUlVkWHE0VU8wYjVNVk1DMEhYRzNod3xBQ3Jtc0ttYmlsZnN0V1BHSUM0NS1JMER3Z25kRHJpRVZXT1diYjNaa2l5emFvdDFFeld4MWhqbS1kb0RhMktXVHd3cU42TnlORk9XR2ZYekpRRGhGLTFma3BEWXFxbXZ2NWdYRjhpeG5iOGNsU0RwMmVyRFVZUQ&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.videolan.org%2F&amp;v=KY38deZrl7s\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> https://www.videolan.org/</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4XVR</span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&amp;redir_token=QUFFLUhqbVhicVEwdFFITTNZUzQxcFV6dUtBZ0JQYjNLUXxBQ3Jtc0treHB3VzBORnFlS2JoQ1NOZUNRSEZleURFT25QT1FTdTlaYVkwN0I4ZzNndThJd1FIZHI4dnpMYUt1b1JZVl9GeEtLX3JXa0pxYkFhb3VPYWx6Z2JOY20zaHE3QklVZ1NRQTdWZXhKejR1SVpjbWVGZw&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fm.4xvr.net%2F&amp;v=KY38deZrl7s\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> https://m.4xvr.net/</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">PS VR2</span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&amp;redir_token=QUFFLUhqbkJ4NHREa3ZodGJSdmt0ck4tMFBkbGQ5cVFyd3xBQ3Jtc0ttTFNyOVBQQmUtaTJZTmhMaVZXWkNlWlBoZk82QWNiZ0Jjc2kwa1RqNW1oc0VnYV9fQ0owSURfTEZWclZpQ2ZGVnVFTmlWUEVuMWR1UFRLMFhOQTBrWGU2WFZReGFQcWsxYjhEM0VLTUl2TFNjVFBIcw&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Famzn.to%2F47TKn4F&amp;v=KY38deZrl7s\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> https://amzn.to/47TKn4F</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">PS VR2 PC Adapter</span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&amp;redir_token=QUFFLUhqbEgwQ2o1Z3FfWlk1Sms1eWRwTWhaak9JVlFoUXxBQ3Jtc0tsaTFJY3BUWTZWY3lobS1vWnZKQmpvX2NQNGV3M3NnOUpyMnJEaDhlcXktSk9BZmdqbnJ2ZlUteU9UMFd0SkhZZXlVcHdJalU4WmRsSkFUMjE3WTdSS0NxczAzbWE5ZjFSOVMxMmU5UHdka0YtM2RWUQ&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Famzn.to%2F3BxVq7B&amp;v=KY38deZrl7s\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> https://amzn.to/3BxVq7B</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Top Gun 3D</span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&amp;redir_token=QUFFLUhqa1p6VVp2cVhTTU9Fb09PYjdYMDFITUFxc2V4QXxBQ3Jtc0ttSk9qOWY4djIzbktGbG85ajZ4Y2VYMmJlTjQxMTJ1V1hiOEE0SGRSV3VwQU9CeUtvdnoxSE9rb2VTYU1XYUZHMzk2ZjFSRE9YNUMzcGxGY09NRFl3TEFjWTlwXzIxSnl3VUxZY2hYVkdDaDNrZFJ4aw&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Famzn.to%2F4h3HylY&amp;v=KY38deZrl7s\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> https://amzn.to/4h3HylY</span></a></p>",

            "content_html": "<p>It‚Äôs been a few months since the PlayStation Portal launched, and while it initially faced mixed and negative feedback, it has been selling incredibly well. In some markets, it remains difficult to find, proving that despite its flaws, there‚Äôs a strong demand for the device. As someone who relies on Remote Play frequently, I picked one up as soon as I could and have been using it regularly. While I have some major gripes with it, I also think it has a lot to offer. Let‚Äôs break it all down, starting with the hardware.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__video\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"314\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/z21i63eJUro\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></iframe></figure>\n<h2>The Hardware: Design Pros and Cons</h2>\n<p>When the PlayStation Portal was first leaked, I did a reaction video, and my opinion hasn‚Äôt changed‚ÄîI still dislike the design. The overall aesthetic of the PS5 generation just doesn‚Äôt appeal to me, especially when compared to previous PlayStation generations. It‚Äôs strange, considering that Mark Cerny has led PlayStation console design since the Vita, yet the PS5 and its accessories feel like such a radical departure from his past work.</p>\n<p>That said, while the Portal looks odd, its form factor is actually fantastic for ergonomics. It sits between the Steam Deck and the Nintendo Switch in size, but many reviews‚Äîand my own experience‚Äîsuggest that it‚Äôs more comfortable to hold than both. This is because it essentially splits a DualSense controller in half, placing the screen in the middle. This design makes it one of the most comfortable handhelds to use for long sessions.</p>\n<p>The placement of the charging port and aux port could be better, as they‚Äôre slightly difficult to reach. However, I do appreciate the small lip on the back of the device, which makes it easy to pick up and hold without smudging the screen. But while the physical design has its strengths, the screen introduces one of the Portal‚Äôs biggest flaws‚Äîits HDR issues.</p>\n<h2>HDR Issues: A Major Problem</h2>\n<p>The PlayStation Portal has significant problems with HDR when streaming via Remote Play. Many users, including myself, have encountered this issue, and the lack of updates to fix it is frustrating. Even worse are the absurd workarounds being suggested online, which are simply unacceptable.<br><br></p>\n<blockquote class=\"reddit-embed-bq\" data-embed-height=\"546\"><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/PlaystationPortal/comments/185m4dc/hdr_comparison_shots/\">HDR Comparison shots</a><br>by<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/bombchu_/\">u/bombchu_</a> in<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/PlaystationPortal/\">PlaystationPortal</a></blockquote>\n<p>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://embed.reddit.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"UTF-8\"></script>\n</p>\n<p>For those unfamiliar, here‚Äôs the problem: the Portal receives an HDR signal from the PS5, despite being an SDR LCD screen that doesn‚Äôt have the luminance range to properly display HDR content. This results in overexposed, blown-out whites, making some games nearly unplayable. For example, in NHL games, the ice and bright jerseys become indistinguishable, creating a terrible experience. I‚Äôve also noticed this issue in games like Spider-Man and Hogwarts Legacy, where the sky turns into a solid white blotch, losing all cloud detail and depth.</p>\n<p>The most commonly suggested solution? Unplugging your PS5‚Äôs HDMI cable every time you want to use Remote Play. That‚Äôs a ridiculous fix that completely defeats the purpose of a remote experience. Other suggestions include turning off VRR, limiting the PS5 to 1080p, or disabling 120Hz refresh rates‚Äîthough these solutions seem more related to latency than HDR. To make matters worse, when using Remote Play, you cannot access the PS5‚Äôs Screen and Video settings to disable HDR, meaning there‚Äôs no easy way to fix this problem without physically interacting with your console.</p>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper gallery-wrapper--wide\"><div class=\"gallery\"  data-is-empty=\"false\" data-translation=\"Add images\" data-columns=\"2\">\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://kacboy.com/blog/media/posts/23/gallery/ps-portal-rant.00_04_17_23.still001.png\" data-size=\"1920x1080\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://kacboy.com/blog/media/posts/23/gallery/ps-portal-rant.00_04_17_23.still001-thumbnail.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://kacboy.com/blog/media/posts/23/gallery/ps-portal-rant.00_04_45_05.still003.png\" data-size=\"1920x1080\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://kacboy.com/blog/media/posts/23/gallery/ps-portal-rant.00_04_45_05.still003-thumbnail.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n</div></div>\n<h2>Testing the Issue: What‚Äôs Really Going On?</h2>\n<p>I ran multiple tests on my PS5, TV, and Portal setup to understand the root of the issue. Here‚Äôs what I found:</p>\n<h3>Test Scenarios</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>HDMI Link (Optimal Setup):</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>HDR Auto ‚Üí Problem occurs</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>HDR Off ‚Üí Fixes the issue</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>HDMI Unplugged:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>HDR Auto ‚Üí Problem occurs</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>HDR Off ‚Üí Fixes the issue</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>No HDMI Link:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>HDR Auto ‚Üí Problem occurs</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>HDR Off ‚Üí Fixes the issue</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The key takeaway? HDMI Link is not the issue; it‚Äôs the way the PS5 interprets HDR compatibility with the TV and sends the signal to the Portal.</p>\n<p>To further verify this, I tested Remote Play using the official Android app and PS Play on a phone that supports HDR. Both apps exhibited the same blown-out whites when HDR was enabled on the PS5 but disabled in the app. However, when HDR was enabled on both the PS5 and the app, the image looked great.</p>\n<p>One interesting discovery: if you connect to your PS5 <strong>while it is already inside the Screen and Video settings menu</strong>, you can still adjust HDR settings remotely. This means the PS5 is capable of dynamically adjusting the HDR output during a Remote Play session‚Äîit just doesn‚Äôt allow users to access these settings normally. A simple firmware update from Sony could fix this by either (1) allowing users to access the Screen and Video settings during Remote Play or (2) automatically disabling HDR output when streaming to a non-HDR device like the Portal.</p>\n<h2>Latency Issues: Improving but Not Perfect</h2>\n<p>Sony released an update (version 2.06) on April 2nd, which reportedly improved video bitrate quality. While I‚Äôve noticed that the Portal now holds its 1080p connection better, some latency and stuttering issues remain. Previously, if my TV was streaming video, the Portal‚Äôs stream quality would degrade and never recover unless I manually disconnected and reconnected. Since the update, it appears to handle these situations more gracefully, but only time will tell how well this holds up over extended use.</p>\n<h2>Hacking the Portal: TheFlow0‚Äôs Findings</h2>\n<p>Earlier this year, hacker TheFlow0 managed to exploit the Portal, but Sony quickly patched the vulnerability in version 2.06. While this is disappointing for those of us who hoped to run homebrew apps on the device, TheFlow0 stated that he never intended to release the exploit publicly. He also noted that officially reporting security flaws to Sony only delays the inevitable patches by a few weeks. At some point, the exploit details will be disclosed publicly, but for now, Sony has locked down the device.</p>\n<h2>The Future of the Portal</h2>\n<p>The PlayStation Portal remains a mixed bag. On the one hand, it offers a fantastic ergonomic experience and a continually improving streaming quality. On the other hand, the HDR issue is a significant flaw that needs urgent attention.</p>\n<p>Sony has two potential solutions: either give users access to the Screen and Video settings during Remote Play or implement a backend fix that forces SDR output when streaming to non-HDR devices. Until then, Portal users will have to deal with frustrating workarounds.</p>\n<p>If you‚Äôre experiencing this issue, I‚Äôd love to hear about your setup‚Äîwhat kind of TV are you using, and are you seeing the same problems? Let me know in the comments, and let‚Äôs hope Sony addresses this sooner rather than later.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__video\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"314\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/8P-7_CwNNw4\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></iframe></figure>\n<hr>\n<p><span class=\"yt-core-attributed-string yt-core-attributed-string--white-space-pre-wrap\" dir=\"auto\"><span class=\"yt-core-attributed-string--link-inherit-color\" dir=\"auto\">PS Portal </span><span class=\"yt-core-attributed-string--link-inherit-color\" dir=\"auto\"><a class=\"yt-core-attributed-string__link yt-core-attributed-string__link--call-to-action-color\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&amp;redir_token=QUFFLUhqbEFZSHBNM3pFYTZyVXBQOFhuNTVYR1owcDZmQXxBQ3Jtc0ttdEZoMDE5dkx4VFRtdzFzZWZsVUtHU0lIWHVMdmtRVkh5MjNMbXhDT0l2S1Awc0VIZXp2Y3RTaVdVMkZPbjNsM1NaY05UZWM5NmN3bWxZclNHZ0F1N2drbm9pRkVfRlRpWnJKN3l4blFYVVUydWc3VQ&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Famzn.to%2F3VwoRi3&amp;v=z21i63eJUro\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" force-new-state=\"true\" tabindex=\"0\">https://amzn.to/3VwoRi3</a></span></span></p>",
